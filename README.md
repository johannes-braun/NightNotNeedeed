# NightNotNeeded
This is a (...probably yet another) little Bukkit/Spigot (i.e. Minecraft Server) plugin which reduces the amount of players needed to skip the night by sleeping.

## Disclaimer
This is a one-off plugin which will probably not receive any special treatment by me - that is, not much more than half a day of writing the code down.
